# 2D JAVA GAME: BALL

This is my first Java/OOP project, which basically is a 2D game using Java libraries and by modifying the Panel and Window classes.

The game requires only the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys to play. 

The goal is to take the ball into the opponent's goal without conceding to your own goal. The intensity of enemies will increase as you keep scoring.

The IDE used was Jetbrains IntelliJ. I will upload the game's JAR file later.
